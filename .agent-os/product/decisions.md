## Decision 001: Agent OS Product Planning Adoption

**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Date**: 2025-08-09
**Category**: Process
**Stakeholders**: Development Team

### Problem
Need a structured approach for planning and documenting the enterprise MCP server foundation product to ensure comprehensive coverage of requirements and maintain consistency throughout development.

### Decision
Adopt Agent OS product planning methodology with complete documentation structure including mission.md, tech-stack.md, roadmap.md, and decisions.md files.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Ad-hoc planning**: Quick start without formal documentation
   - Pros: Faster initial setup
   - Cons: Lack of structure, potential scope creep, poor communication

2. **Traditional PRD-only approach**: Single comprehensive document
   - Pros: All information in one place
   - Cons: Difficult to maintain, poor AI context efficiency

3. **Agent OS methodology**: Structured multi-file approach
   - Pros: Modular documentation, AI-optimized, decision tracking
   - Cons: Additional setup overhead

### Rationale
Agent OS methodology provides:
- Structured decision tracking with highest override priority
- AI-optimized documentation for ongoing development
- Clear separation of concerns (mission, tech stack, roadmap)
- Proven framework for enterprise product development

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear product vision, structured development phases, trackable decisions
- **Negative**: Initial documentation overhead, need to maintain multiple files
- **Neutral**: Team must learn Agent OS methodology

## Decision 002: FastMCP Framework Selection

**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Date**: 2025-08-09
**Category**: Technology
**Stakeholders**: Development Team, Architecture Team

### Problem
Need to select an MCP (Model Context Protocol) framework that supports enterprise requirements including authentication, scalability, and production deployment.

### Decision
Use FastMCP 2.11+ as the core framework for building the enterprise MCP server foundation.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Raw MCP Implementation**: Build from MCP specification directly
   - Pros: Full control, minimal dependencies
   - Cons: Significant development overhead, reimplementing common patterns

2. **Basic FastMCP**: Use minimal FastMCP setup
   - Pros: Quick start, lightweight
   - Cons: Missing enterprise features like authentication

3. **FastMCP 2.11+ with Enterprise Features**: Latest version with built-in enterprise capabilities
   - Pros: OAuth 2.1, WorkOS AuthKit, latest MCP spec compliance
   - Cons: Newer codebase, potential stability concerns

### Rationale
FastMCP 2.11+ provides:
- Built-in enterprise authentication with OAuth 2.1 and WorkOS AuthKit
- Full compliance with 6/18/2025 MCP specification
- Comprehensive toolkit beyond core MCP (deployment, auth, clients, server composition)
- Active development and maintenance
- Production-ready features out of the box

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Accelerated development, enterprise-ready authentication, spec compliance
- **Negative**: Framework dependency, potential breaking changes in updates
- **Neutral**: Team needs to learn FastMCP patterns and best practices

## Decision 003: Dual-Mode Deployment Architecture

**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Date**: 2025-08-09
**Category**: Architecture
**Stakeholders**: Development Team, DevOps Team

### Problem
Need to support both local development (for rapid iteration) and production cloud deployment (for enterprise use) with minimal configuration differences to avoid development-production gaps.

### Decision
Implement dual-mode deployment architecture supporting uvx for local development and Docker/Kubernetes for production with unified configuration system.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Development-only approach**: Focus on local development first
   - Pros: Faster initial development
   - Cons: Production deployment afterthought, likely environment gaps

2. **Production-first approach**: Build for cloud deployment only
   - Pros: Production-ready from start
   - Cons: Slow local development cycle, complex setup

3. **Dual-mode architecture**: Support both environments equally
   - Pros: Consistent behavior, flexible deployment, development velocity
   - Cons: Additional complexity in configuration management

### Rationale
Dual-mode architecture addresses:
- Development velocity with uvx single-command startup
- Production requirements with containerized deployment
- Environment consistency reducing deployment risks
- Flexibility for different deployment scenarios

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Fast development cycles, production readiness, reduced deployment risks
- **Negative**: Configuration complexity, need to test both modes
- **Neutral**: Additional abstraction layer for storage and services

## Decision 004: Python 3.13+ Version Requirement

**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Date**: 2025-08-09
**Category**: Technology
**Stakeholders**: Development Team

### Problem
Need to select Python version that balances latest features with enterprise compatibility requirements.

### Decision
Require Python 3.13.6+ as the minimum version for the enterprise MCP server foundation.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Python 3.11**: Widely adopted, stable enterprise version
   - Pros: Broad compatibility, proven stability
   - Cons: Missing latest performance improvements and features

2. **Python 3.12**: Recent stable release
   - Pros: Good balance of features and stability
   - Cons: Missing experimental features like free-threading

3. **Python 3.13.6+**: Latest stable with experimental features
   - Pros: Free-threaded mode, JIT compiler, latest async improvements
   - Cons: Newer version may have enterprise adoption lag

### Rationale
Python 3.13.6+ provides:
- Experimental free-threaded mode for improved concurrency
- Preliminary JIT compiler for performance gains
- Enhanced async/await support for high-performance I/O
- Latest security updates and bug fixes
- Forward compatibility for enterprise longevity

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Best performance and latest features, future-proofing
- **Negative**: Potential compatibility issues with older enterprise environments
- **Neutral**: May require container-based deployment in constrained environments

## Decision 005: uv Package Manager Adoption

**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted
**Date**: 2025-08-09
**Category**: Technology
**Stakeholders**: Development Team

### Problem
Need a package manager that supports fast dependency resolution, virtual environment management, and uvx execution for the dual-mode architecture.

### Decision
Adopt uv 0.8.6+ as the primary package manager and uvx for local execution.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **pip + venv**: Traditional Python package management
   - Pros: Universal compatibility, well-known
   - Cons: Slow dependency resolution, manual virtual environment management

2. **Poetry**: Modern dependency management with lock files
   - Pros: Good dependency management, lock files
   - Cons: Slower than uv, doesn't support uvx pattern

3. **uv + uvx**: Modern Rust-based package manager
   - Pros: 10-100x faster, built-in venv, uvx execution support
   - Cons: Newer tool, potential compatibility edge cases

### Rationale
uv provides:
- Exceptional speed (10-100x faster than pip)
- Built-in virtual environment management
- uvx support for direct execution pattern
- Lock file support for reproducible builds
- Active development and growing adoption

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Dramatically faster dependency operations, simplified workflow
- **Negative**: Newer tool with potential edge cases
- **Neutral**: Team needs to learn uv-specific workflows
