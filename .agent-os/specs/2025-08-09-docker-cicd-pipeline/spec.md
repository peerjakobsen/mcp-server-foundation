# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Docker Containerization and CI/CD Pipeline
> Created: 2025-08-09

## Overview

Implement comprehensive Docker containerization with multi-stage builds and a complete GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to enable production-ready deployment of the MCP Server Foundation. This feature will complete Phase 1 requirements and establish the foundation for enterprise-grade continuous integration, automated testing, security scanning, and deployment across multiple environments.

## User Stories

### DevOps Engineer - Container Deployment
As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the MCP server using Docker containers, so that I can ensure consistent environments across development, staging, and production with proper isolation and scalability.

The engineer will build Docker images with multi-stage optimization, deploy to container orchestration platforms, and manage configurations through environment variables while maintaining security best practices.

### Development Team - Automated CI/CD
As a development team member, I want automated testing and deployment pipelines, so that every code change is validated, secured, and deployed without manual intervention while maintaining high quality standards.

The pipeline will automatically run comprehensive tests, perform security scanning, build optimized containers, and deploy to appropriate environments based on branch strategy, providing fast feedback and reducing deployment risks.

### Security Team - Container Security
As a security team member, I want all container images to be scanned for vulnerabilities and built with security hardening, so that production deployments meet enterprise security standards with minimal attack surface.

The system will implement distroless base images, non-root user execution, vulnerability scanning, secrets management, and security policy enforcement throughout the container lifecycle.

## Spec Scope

1. **Multi-Stage Docker Builds** - Optimized development and production containers with security hardening and minimal image sizes
2. **GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline** - Comprehensive automated workflow with testing gates, security scanning, and deployment automation
3. **Container Security Hardening** - Vulnerability scanning, non-root execution, distroless images, and secrets management integration
4. **Environment-Aware Deployment** - Branch-based deployment strategy supporting development, staging, and production environments
5. **Integration with Dual-Mode Architecture** - Seamless compatibility with existing uvx development and production deployment modes

## Out of Scope

- Kubernetes cluster provisioning (infrastructure as code will be separate spec)
- Multi-cloud deployment configurations (handled by existing terraform modules)
- Advanced monitoring dashboards (covered in Phase 4 observability)
- Container orchestration beyond basic Docker Compose for development
- Service mesh integration and advanced networking policies

## Expected Deliverable

1. Multi-stage Dockerfile building successfully for both development and production with optimized layer caching and security hardening
2. Complete GitHub Actions workflow executing automated tests, security scans, container builds, and deployments with proper secret management
3. Container images pushed to GitHub Container Registry with proper tagging strategy and vulnerability scanning reports showing zero critical issues
