# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-09-docker-cicd-pipeline/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Docker Multi-Stage Build Architecture

**Development Stage Requirements:**
- Base image: `python:3.13.6-slim` for development compatibility
- Full development dependencies including testing, linting, and debugging tools
- Hot reload capability with volume mounting for source code
- Development database (SQLite) initialization
- Port exposure: 8000 (HTTP) and debug ports as needed
- Non-root user execution with proper permissions for development workflows

**Production Stage Requirements:**
- Base image: Distroless Python runtime (`gcr.io/distroless/python3`) for minimal attack surface
- Only production dependencies, excluding dev tools and test frameworks
- Multi-layer optimization with dependency and application layers separated
- Health check endpoint implementation (`/health`, `/readiness`, `/liveness`)
- Graceful shutdown handling with signal propagation
- Security hardening: non-root user (uid 1000), read-only filesystem where possible
- Environment-based configuration injection via Pydantic Settings
- Resource limits and CPU/memory optimization

**Build Optimization:**
- Efficient layer caching strategy with dependency installation before code copy
- Multi-platform builds (AMD64, ARM64) for deployment flexibility
- Build arguments for version tagging and environment targeting
- Image size optimization targeting <200MB for production images
- Security scanning integration with vulnerability threshold enforcement

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

**Workflow Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch → Production deployment pipeline
- Push to `develop` branch → Staging deployment pipeline
- Pull requests → Full testing and security scanning pipeline
- Manual workflow dispatch with environment selection
- Scheduled security scanning (weekly dependency and container vulnerability checks)

**Pipeline Stages:**

**Stage 1: Code Quality & Testing**
- Checkout with full git history for proper version detection
- Python 3.13.6 environment setup with uv package manager
- Cache management for uv dependencies and pip wheels
- Ruff formatting check and lint validation (must pass with zero errors)
- MyPy type checking with strict configuration (must pass without `# type: ignore`)
- Bandit security scanning for Python code vulnerabilities
- Safety check for dependency vulnerabilities with automatic PR creation for updates

**Stage 2: Comprehensive Testing**
- Unit test execution with pytest and asyncio support
- Integration test execution against containerized services (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Test coverage reporting with minimum 85% threshold enforcement
- Performance benchmark testing with regression detection
- Parallel test execution for optimal CI/CD speed

**Stage 3: Container Build & Security**
- Docker multi-stage build with layer caching optimization
- Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy/Snyk integration
- Critical vulnerability threshold enforcement (zero critical, ≤5 high)
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation for compliance tracking
- Image signing with cosign for supply chain security
- Multi-platform container builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)

**Stage 4: Deployment & Validation**
- Environment-specific deployment based on branch strategy
- Container registry push to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Semantic versioning with automatic tag generation
- Deployment health check validation
- Rollback capability with automatic failure detection
- Notification integration (Slack/Discord) for deployment status

**Branch Strategy:**
- `main` branch: Production deployment with approval gate
- `develop` branch: Automatic staging deployment
- Feature branches: Testing and security scanning only
- Release branches: Full pipeline with release candidate tagging

### Container Security Implementation

**Base Image Security:**
- Distroless Python runtime eliminating shell and package managers in production
- Minimal package installation with specific version pinning
- Regular base image updates through automated Dependabot PRs
- Image vulnerability scanning with automated alerts for new CVEs

**Runtime Security:**
- Non-privileged user execution (UID 1000, GID 1000)
- Read-only root filesystem with specific writable directories
- Security context dropping unnecessary capabilities
- Resource limits (CPU: 1 core, Memory: 512MB) with horizontal scaling capability
- Network policy enforcement for container-to-container communication

**Secrets Management:**
- GitHub Secrets integration for sensitive configuration
- Environment-specific secret injection without exposure in logs
- Database credentials and API keys managed through secure injection
- OAuth provider keys and JWT signing keys stored in encrypted GitHub Secrets
- Local development secrets through python-keyring integration

### Environment Configuration Integration

**Development Environment:**
- Docker Compose configuration for local development with hot reload
- Volume mounting for source code development workflow
- Service orchestration (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO) for local testing
- Debug port exposure and IDE integration support
- Environment variable injection through .env file mounting

**Staging Environment:**
- Automated deployment to staging infrastructure
- Production-like configuration with test data seeding
- Integration testing against external services (OAuth providers, cloud storage)
- Performance monitoring and alerting validation
- Load testing capability for performance validation

**Production Environment:**
- Production deployment with health check validation
- Blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates
- Automatic rollback on health check failures
- Production monitoring integration with alerting
- Compliance logging and audit trail maintenance

## External Dependencies

**Container Runtime & Registry:**
- **Docker Engine 28.2+** - Multi-stage build support and security features
- **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** - Official GitHub integration with OIDC authentication
- **Justification:** Native GitHub integration with superior security and no additional cost

**CI/CD Platform & Tools:**
- **GitHub Actions** - Native repository integration with extensive marketplace
- **uv 0.8.6+** - High-performance package management for consistent builds
- **Trivy/Snyk** - Container and dependency vulnerability scanning
- **cosign** - Container image signing for supply chain security
- **Justification:** Best-in-class tooling with proven enterprise adoption and security track record

**Development & Testing:**
- **Docker Compose v2** - Local development environment orchestration
- **pytest-docker** - Container integration testing framework
- **testcontainers-python** - Ephemeral container testing for reliable CI/CD
- **Justification:** Industry standard for containerized application testing and development workflows
