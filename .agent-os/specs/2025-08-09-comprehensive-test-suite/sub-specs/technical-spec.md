# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-09-comprehensive-test-suite/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Test Structure and Organization
- Tests organized in `tests/` directory mirroring `src/` structure
- Test files named `test_<module>.py` for each source module
- Fixture definitions in `tests/conftest.py` for reusability
- Test utilities in `tests/utils/` for helper functions

### Configuration Testing (`tests/test_config.py`)
- Test all DeploymentMode enum values and auto-configuration
- Validate Pydantic field validators and constraints
- Test environment variable override precedence
- Verify mode-specific defaults (SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for prod)
- Test configuration loading from .env files
- Validate error handling for invalid configurations

### FastMCP Integration Testing (`tests/test_main.py`)
- Test MCPServerFoundation initialization with various configs
- Verify tool registration with @app.tool decorator
- Test resource registration with @app.resource decorator
- Validate HTTP server startup and shutdown
- Test health check endpoints return correct responses
- Mock FastMCP for isolated unit testing

### MCP Protocol Testing (`tests/test_protocol.py`)
- Validate JSON-RPC 2.0 message structure
- Test error responses for malformed requests
- Verify proper MCP headers handling
- Test tool invocation request/response cycle
- Validate resource listing and retrieval
- Test concurrent request handling

### Test Fixtures and Utilities
- Create async test fixtures using pytest-asyncio
- Mock external dependencies (database, storage, Redis)
- Provide test configuration factory functions
- Create MCP client test utilities for integration tests
- Implement test data builders for complex objects

### Coverage Configuration
- Configure pytest-cov in pyproject.toml
- Set minimum coverage threshold at 70%
- Generate HTML reports in htmlcov/ directory
- Exclude test files and __init__.py from coverage
- Configure branch coverage for comprehensive testing

### Performance Requirements
- Unit tests complete in under 30 seconds
- Integration tests isolated with proper teardown
- Parallel test execution with pytest-xdist
- Test database cleanup after each test run
- Minimal test interdependencies

### CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow for test execution
- Run tests on Python 3.13+ matrix
- Upload coverage reports to workflow artifacts
- Fail builds if coverage drops below 70%
- Cache dependencies for faster builds

## External Dependencies (Conditional)

The following testing dependencies need to be added to pyproject.toml:

- **pytest-asyncio** - Async test support for FastMCP handlers
- **pytest-cov** - Coverage reporting integration
- **pytest-mock** - Enhanced mocking capabilities
- **pytest-xdist** - Parallel test execution
- **httpx** - Async HTTP client for integration tests
- **faker** - Test data generation

**Justification:** These are standard Python testing tools that integrate well with pytest and provide essential testing capabilities for async code, coverage reporting, and test isolation.
