# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Comprehensive Unit Test Suite
> Created: 2025-08-09

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive unit test suite for the MCP Server Foundation that achieves 70%+ code coverage, validates all core functionality, and establishes testing best practices for future development. The test suite will cover configuration management, FastMCP integration, MCP protocol compliance, and ensure production readiness through automated quality gates.

## User Stories

### Developer Testing Experience

As a developer, I want to run comprehensive unit tests with a single command, so that I can validate my changes haven't broken existing functionality.

The developer runs `uv run pytest` to execute the entire test suite, receiving clear feedback on test results, code coverage metrics, and any failures with detailed error messages. The test suite runs quickly (under 30 seconds for unit tests) and provides helpful assertions that guide debugging when tests fail.

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

As a DevOps engineer, I want automated test execution in the CI/CD pipeline, so that code quality is maintained and only tested code reaches production.

The CI/CD pipeline automatically runs the test suite on every push and pull request, blocking merges if tests fail or coverage drops below 70%. Test results are clearly reported in GitHub Actions with coverage badges and detailed failure logs.

### MCP Protocol Compliance

As an MCP server maintainer, I want comprehensive protocol compliance tests, so that the server correctly implements the MCP specification and works with all MCP clients.

The test suite validates JSON-RPC 2.0 message handling, tool registration and execution, resource management, and proper error responses. Integration tests verify the server works correctly with FastMCP's built-in HTTP transport.

## Spec Scope

1. **Configuration Testing** - Validate environment-aware configuration with mode-specific defaults and Pydantic validation
2. **FastMCP Integration Tests** - Test tool registration, resource handling, and HTTP transport functionality
3. **Core Server Tests** - Verify MCPServerFoundation initialization, health checks, and lifecycle management
4. **Test Fixtures and Utilities** - Create reusable test fixtures, mocks, and helper functions for consistent testing
5. **Coverage Reporting** - Configure pytest-cov for HTML and terminal coverage reports with 70%+ target

## Out of Scope

- End-to-end browser testing (Phase 5)
- Load testing and performance benchmarking (Phase 5)
- Security penetration testing (Phase 5)
- Testing of unimplemented auth module (Phase 2)
- Testing of cloud deployment configurations (Phase 3)
- Testing of monitoring/observability features (Phase 4)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Test suite achieving 70%+ code coverage with clear, maintainable test code
2. All tests passing with `uv run pytest` command completing in under 30 seconds
3. GitHub Actions workflow configured to run tests on push/PR with coverage reporting
